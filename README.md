🌐 Multimodal Education Creator
✨ AI-powered Learning — Where Concepts Meet Visuals

Multimodal Education Creator is a cutting-edge educational content engine that combines the power of large language models and AI image generation to produce rich, engaging, and visually intuitive learning materials — all from a simple topic prompt.

🚀 Vision
Education should be immersive, creative, and accessible.

This project transforms abstract concepts into:

Clear, structured text explanations
Stunning AI-generated visuals
Making learning easier, faster, and more engaging.

🧠 What It Does
Given any topic, the system generates:

✨ Structured Concept Breakdown – Clear and organized explanation
🎯 Key Learning Points – Important highlights to improve retention
🖼️ AI-Generated Visuals – Custom images that reinforce understanding
The result is true multimodal content — combining text + visuals for deeper learning impact.

🛠️ Core Technology
Layer	Technology
🚀 AI Language Model	Gemini Pro
🎨 Image Generation	Stable Diffusion Turbo (SD-Turbo)
🖥️ Interface	Streamlit
🧩 Backend / Orchestration	Python
📌 Note: This version does not use a vector database. The focus is on high-quality generation with a clean and simple architecture.
